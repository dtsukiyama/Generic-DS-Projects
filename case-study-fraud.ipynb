    "# Fraud Detection\n",

    "### Design Doc\n",
    "\n",
    "__Scope__\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is to follow this design document to build our initial baseline model and reuse as much code as possible and do so relatively quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I first tested this approach with this data: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud\n",
    "\n",
    ">The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then tested this approach with a more difficult dataset, which is available here: https://github.com/CapitalOneRecruiting/DS\n",
    "\n",
    "__Goal__\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict ```Class``` label, which represents fraudulent activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```Class``` label is relatively rare, which means our dataset is imbalanced. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "__Baseline Feature Engineering__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove features that entirely null.\n",
    "2. Deal with missing values.\n",
    "3. Time based features: hour, day, etc.. (if any).\n",
    "4. Categorical features should be one-hot encoded (if any).\n",
    "5. Dollar features should be logged (if any).\n",
    "6. Non monetary continuous features scaled.\n",
    "7. Perhaps some row level statistics.\n",
    "8. Upsampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to be wary of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - leakage\n",
    "    - features that are in our test set (or production) that may not be in our training data\n",
    "    - When oversampling, do not oversample test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Baseline Model and Error Metric__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tree based model, XGboost. The decision to use XGBoost over other tree implementations comes down to speed, flexibility, and performance. XGBoost allows for custom optimization functions and parallelized for speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. I think we will be looking at the precision and recall on our two classes as well as AUC. XGBoost allows for the following evaluation metrics: log loss, auc, and auc pr (precision and recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Binary classification problem\n",
    "    - Imbalanced data\n",
    "    - True positive and/or False positive rate may be important to judge performance\n",
